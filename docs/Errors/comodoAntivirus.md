When you get an IndexOutOfBoundsException maybe the problem is with your Comodo Antivirus.  We detected the bug at Windows 8 operating system with Comodo
Antivirus 12.2.2.8012 product version. You have to open Comodo->Settings->Containment->Auto-Containment,
and then disable it (swith off the check mark that can be seen below). You have to restart your IDE.
